# Analyzing-and-Predicting-Youth-Substance-Usage-Insights-from-Decision-Tree-Analysis

This project explores youth alcohol consumption patterns using decision tree models and data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). The analysis addresses three key objectives: binary classification of alcohol use ever used vs. never used, multi-class classification of alcohol usage frequency, and regression to predict the age of first alcohol use. By employing decision trees, bagging, and random forests, the study identifies critical demographic and experiential factors influencing alcohol-related behaviors. The insights derived from this analysis aim to inform targeted interventions and public health strategies to mitigate the risks associated with alcohol use among young individuals. Comprehensive evaluation metrics and feature importance analyses ensure the robustness and interpretability of the models.
